# Customer_Behavior_Analysis
Data Analytics project showcasing customer behavior analysis using python, sql and power bi.
🔍 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, covering data extraction, exploration, cleaning, querying, visualization, and reporting.
The goal is to derive meaningful insights from raw data and present them through interactive dashboards and professional reports suitable for business decision-making.

The project follows real-world analytics practices using Python, SQL (MySQL), and Power BI, along with a final presentation created using Gamma.

📁 Dataset

Source: (Public dataset / Kaggle / Internal / Mock dataset — update as needed)

Format: CSV

Data Type: Structured

Description:
The dataset contains records related to (sales / customers / transactions / operations — customize here) and is used to analyze trends, patterns, and key performance metrics.
